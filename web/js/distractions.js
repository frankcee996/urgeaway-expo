/* ==========================================================================
   Distractions — the pool the "I HAVE AN URGE" button draws from.

   Design note on "how many activities": rather than hand-writing hundreds
   of nearly-identical strings, most categories here are built from small
   content banks combined at random (a category + a letter, a setting + a
   missing item + a twist, etc). A few categories (countries x letters,
   subjects x "60 seconds") alone produce hundreds of distinct combinations,
   so in practice this never feels like it's repeating — which is the
   actual goal, more reliably than a fixed list would achieve.

   Every generator returns { id, run(container, onFinish) } — same run()
   contract as activities.js, so it drops into the same full-screen runner.
